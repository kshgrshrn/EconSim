Welcome to EconSim by Team financiallyinept for FinHack2025.

An interactive economic policy simulation platform that lets users experiment with fiscal, trade, and regulatory policies and instantly see their macro and market-level effects.

Built for learning, intuition, and exploration. Not for real-world forecasting.

⸻

What It Does
	•	Simulates economic policies using deterministic, theory-based models
	•	Shows directional impact on GDP, inflation, employment, revenue, and welfare
	•	Visualizes supply–demand shifts and time-series trends
	•	Provides clear, contextual explanations of results

All simulations are transparent and reproducible.

⸻

Supported Policies
	•	Tax: indirect, income, corporate, tariffs
	•	Subsidy: consumer and producer
	•	Price Controls: ceilings, floors, minimum wage
	•	Trade: export subsidies and restrictions

Markets include fuel, food, electronics, and agriculture with configurable elasticities.

⸻

How It Works
	1.	User selects a policy and parameters
	2.	Deterministic simulation engine applies economic rules
	3.	Macro indicators and market curves are generated
	4.	Results are translated into qualitative impacts

No external data. No probabilistic models.

Tech Stack

Frontend
	•	React 18 + TypeScript
	•	Vite
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	shadcn/ui
	•	Recharts
	•	React Hook Form + Zod

Backend

⸻

Use Cases
	•	Learning economic concepts through interaction
	•	Exploring policy trade-offs
	•	Visualizing market responses to regulation

⸻

Running Locally
  npm install
  npm run dev

Simulations run fully in the browser.
Explanation features require Supabase Edge Functions.
